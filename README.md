# barcelona-air-pollution
The data reported in opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat related to the air pollution in the city is in a awful format for doing any sort of data analysis project. Therefore, I have cleaned it, created a time series out of it and uploaded it here for anyone to use and not spend hours cleaning it.

Each dataframe contains the measurements of each pollutant (specified in the dataframe name), the datetime as index, and a column for each of the measurement stations where data was gathered.
